# Path-finding-algorithm

This project is a path finding simulator in python and Pygame.

    1. Click on any block in the grid to create a starting position for the algorithm, the block will turn green.

    2. Click on any other block to turn it into an destination block, the block will turn red.

    3. Optional, click on some remaining blocks to turn them into wall blocks (you can draw a maze with the wall blocks), the block will turn gray.

    Press the start button and watch how the algorithm finds his way to the destination. After it found the destination block it will draw a path in orange.

Feel free the modify it and play around with the code. Have fun!
